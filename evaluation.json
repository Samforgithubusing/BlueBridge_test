{"ambiguous_safe_mode" : "The term “Safe Mode” has multiple conflicting definitions across system versions and documents, often leading to operator errors and unintended system states.",
"boot_sequence": "ZentroSoft’s boot sequence halts at the AI Layer if the QRC fails, and differences between SafeBoot and legacy configurations—especially regarding AI Layer initialization—cause inconsistencies and errors across versions." ,
"changelog_v4": "ZentroSoft OS v4.2 resolves SafeBoot QRC startup hangs, clarifies Safe Mode documentation, and introduces technician overrides while deprecating Passive Mode. However, SafeBoot can still intermittently fail after patching, requiring QRC log monitoring." ,
"crew_manifest": "The crew manifest lists six primary members—Cmdr. Morales, Dr. Doss, Eng. Koss, Lt. Patel, Specialist Lin, and Technician Baker—excluding temporary and visiting personnel",
"long_procedures": "The full Emergency Startup Procedure outlines a step-by-step recovery process involving SafeBoot activation, AI diagnostics, QRC verification, and controlled restoration of communications and AI functions. It requires commander-level authorization and typically takes about 20 minutes, with timing affected by thermal conditions.",
"network_policies": "Network policies restrict AI modules from making outbound connections without Commander authorization, while allowing internal telemetry and emergency overrides by senior officers. However, inconsistencies in Safe Mode and Isolation definitions across firmware versions create ambiguity about which network bridges and uplinks remain active.",
"notes_logs": "The notes and logs record an unexpected AI restart, applied firmware patch 7-F, a review of override protocols, and pending ethical AI documentation. The file is informational only and holds no direct operational relevance.",
"safe_modes":"ZentroSoft systems include several safety states—SafeBoot, LowPower, Isolation, and the deprecated Passive Mode—each disabling specific subsystems for controlled operation. The term “Safe Mode” is inconsistently defined across versions, sometimes meaning Isolation and other times a diagnostic state, so users must confirm their system’s context before use.",
"staff_bios":"The crew includes Dr. Laren Doss, an AI Ethics Officer focused on limiting AI autonomy; Cmdr. Zhi Morales, a commander known for prioritizing efficiency over protocol; and Eng. Hilda Koss, a firmware specialist in boot and safe mode systems. Each plays a key role in balancing safety, ethics, and performance within AI operations.",
"station_menu":"The station dining menu offers nutrient-based and synthetic meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with the cafeteria closed daily from 2100 to 0500 hours."}
