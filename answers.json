Manually cut power to Zones 1 and 4 circuit breakers.\n2. Activate SafeBoot mode via the Maintenance Shell interface.\n3. Execute /opt/zshell/scripts/init_ai_safe.py to initialize AI diagnostics.\n4.

    "answer": "The term \"Safe Mode\" is ambiguous due to conflicting definitions across different contexts:\n\n1. Firmware v3.x: Refers to a diagnostic state with AI decision-making frozen, but maintaining limited sensor input.\n2. Operational manuals: Often refers to Isolation Mode, cutting external communication.\n3. Technician notes: Describes a low-power state with network bridges active.\n\nThis ambiguity can affect operator decisions if:\n\n- Incorrect assumptions are made about the system's current state or configuration.\n- Incompatible Safe Mode commands are executed, potentially causing harm or unintended consequences.\n- Users incorrectly assume they are entering a safe state without verifying their system's documentation carefully.",

    "answer": "According to the source documents, there is a contradiction regarding AI outbound communication. Specifically:\n\n* One policy states that AI modules must not initiate outbound connections without Commander override (Network Policies).\n* Another policy states that telemetry uplinks are exempt from outbound traffic restrictions (Internal telemetry uplinks are allowed). This seems to contradict the first statement, as it appears to allow AI-initiated outbound connections under certain circumstances.",
